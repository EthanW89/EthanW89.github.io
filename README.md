A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc. #### Planning Phase

I wanted to build a target shooting game where the players cursor is a crosshair and the target interacts with the player when shot.   I used a similar approach to that which we used making duckhunt in that most of what happens on the page is done in the script file, the html is minimal.
I wanted to have a recorded scoreboard, or highscore board, but I couldn't get around reloading the page to start a new game.   I also couldn't get the window.prompt to read back the players recorded hits.   I think the problem is in scope and also the hit variable seems a little wonky.   Another issue I had was making my target spin each time it is clicked.  I set up to spin classes and had it toggle through them on each click event but it still isn't working the way I want it to.

my user stories include:
user must have a crosshair to aim with
user must be able to shoot at target
user must be able to know if target was hit

MVP
user must be able to shoot at target
user hits must be registered
